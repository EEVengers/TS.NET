# General configuration
#
# Driver selects the hardware driver to use.
# Value: String, with possible values of XMDA/Simulator.
Driver: XDMA

# MaxChannelCount configures the maximum number of channels possible.
# At runtime, the processing logic could use any number up to this maximum.
# This has a large correlation with the amount of RAM usage.
# Value: Integer, typically 4 for a 4-channel thunderscope.
MaxChannelCount: 4

# MaxChannelDataLength configures the maximum data length of each channel possible.
# At runtime, the processing logic could use any number up to this maximum.
# This has a large correlation with the amount of RAM usage.
# Value: Integer, typically 1000000. Larger values may be used for longer triggered captures, with a large increase in RAM usage.
MaxChannelDataLength: 1000000

# HardwareThreadProcessorAffinity configures the thread processor affinity for the hardware capture & control thread.
# Typically should remain as -1 to allow full control by operating system, but user may wish to experiment.
# Value: Integer, in range of -1 to the number of CPU cores available. -1 = not set, 0 = CPU core 0, 1 = CPU core 1, etc.
HardwareThreadProcessorAffinity: -1

# ProcessingThreadProcessorAffinity configures the thread processor affinity for the processing thread.
# Typically should remain as -1 to allow full control by operating system, but user may wish to experiment.
# Value: Integer, in range of -1 to the number of CPU cores available. -1 = not set, 0 = CPU core 0, 1 = CPU core 1, etc.
ProcessingThreadProcessorAffinity: -1

# ControlThreadProcessorAffinity configures the thread processor affinity for the control thread.
# Typically should remain as -1 to allow full control by operating system, but user may wish to experiment.
# Value: Integer, in range of -1 to the number of CPU cores available. -1 = not set, 0 = CPU core 0, 1 = CPU core 1, etc.
ControlThreadProcessorAffinity: -1

# Calibration configuration
#
# Calibration is a structure containing the DC calibration data for a specific thunderscope.
#
# AttenuatorGain sets the multiplier for the frontend relay-switched attenuator.
# Value: Double, nominally 0.02 with slight variation based on calibration.
