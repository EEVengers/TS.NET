# General configuration
#
# Key: HardwareDriver
# Value: String, with possible values of libtslitex/Simulation.
# Selects the hardware driver to use.
#
# Key: HardwareRevision
# Value: String, with appropriate value for the Driver used.
# Selects the hardware revision.
#
# Key: MaxCaptureLength
# Value: Integer, typically 10000000. Larger values may be used for longer triggered captures.
# Configures the maximum data length of each channel possible. At runtime, the processing logic could use any number up to this maximum. This has a large correlation with the amount of RAM usage.
#
# Key: ScpiPort
# Value: Integer, typically 5025.
# Configures the port number for the SCPI service.
#
# Key: DataPort
# Value: Integer, typically 5026.
# Configures the port number for the Data service.
#
# Key: WaveformBufferReader
# Value: String, with one of None/DataServer.
# Configures the reader that will access the waveform buffer.

HardwareDriver: libtslitex
HardwareRevision: Rev5.1
MaxCaptureLength: 50000000

# Threading configuration
#
# Key: HardwareThreadProcessorAffinity 
# Value: Integer, in range of -1 to the number of CPU cores available. -1 = not set, 0 = CPU core 0, 1 = CPU core 1, etc.
# Configures the thread processor affinity for the hardware capture & control thread. Typically should remain as -1 to allow full control by operating system, but user may wish to experiment.
#
# Key: PreProcessingThreadProcessorAffinity 
# Value: Integer, in range of -1 to the number of CPU cores available. -1 = not set, 0 = CPU core 0, 1 = CPU core 1, etc.
# Configures the thread processor affinity for the pre-processing thread. Typically should remain as -1 to allow full control by operating system, but user may wish to experiment.
